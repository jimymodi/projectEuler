My solutions to projecteuler.net problems

# projectEuler Problems
These are my solutions to the problems of [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

I have shared this on Github for the following reasons

* To keep a track of my progress.
* To be able to access the code from anywhere.
* So that it motivates me to solve more exercises.
* In the hope that some pythonista might see this repo and suggest me towards making the code pythonic :-)

Feel free to fork this repo if it may help you in any way.

Note: I have not included some problems solution like of problem 1, 6 etc. I have solved them directly in the console and I dont have a copy of it while creating this repo :).
